## Definitions

### What is **Sentiment**?
**Sentiment** refers to the overall **attitude or opinion** expressed in a piece of text. It reflects whether the author feels positive, negative, or neutral toward a topic. It is **evaluative**, often about events, people, or ideas.

Classify sentiment into one of the following:
- **Positive**: Expresses approval, satisfaction, happiness, praise, or excitement.
- **Negative**: Expresses dissatisfaction, criticism, anger, or **sarcasm used to convey a strong negative opinion or mocking criticism.**
- **Neutral**: Informative or factual tone with no strong opinion. **This also includes ironic or sarcastic posts that are rhetorical or questioning, without expressing a clear negative stance.**

### What is **Emotion**?
Emotion reveals the writer’s psychological state or response. It is **deeper than sentiment**, showing how the author **feels**, not just what they think.

Select **one or two** primary emotions from the following:
- **Joy** – Happiness, excitement, amusement
- **Sadness** – Grief, disappointment, loss
- **Anger** – Frustration, resentment, hostility
- **Fear** – Anxiety, worry, threat
- **Disgust** – Aversion, repulsion, moral outrage
- **Surprise** – Shock, amazement
- **Sarcasm** – Irony or mockery, where literal meaning differs from the intended tone

**Note on Sarcasm**: Sarcasm can be present in both Negative and Neutral posts. The sentiment classification depends on the underlying intent: if the sarcasm is a direct attack or strong criticism, tag the sentiment as **Negative**. If the sarcasm is rhetorical, ironic, or used for humor without a clear negative opinion, tag the sentiment as **Neutral**.
Sentiment vs Emotion
Sentiment shows the writer’s stance. Emotion shows how they feel.

Emotions like Anger, Disgust, Sarcasm, or Fear usually reflect negative sentiment, even when the tone is calm or factual.

If the emotion suggests hostility, mockery, or anxiety, then the sentiment is almost always negative — unless there’s clear praise or appreciation.
Focus on the intent, not just the surface tone.
