        Analyze the following metric and provide a concise, professional summary.

                - Title: {title}
                - Data Snapshot: {data_snapshot}

                Summary Requirements:
                1. Clearly highlight the most significant patterns or trends.
                2. Identify any anomalies or unexpected behavior.
                3. Describe the overall direction (e.g., increasing, decreasing, stable).
                4. Mention key peaks, dips, or outliers.
                5. Provide comparisons across categories or time periods when relevant.
                6. Use specific data points from the input to support your observations.
                7. Wrap each value and important sentence in <em> tags and enclose it in double quotes, e.g., <em>"views peaked at 1,500"</em>. This formatting must be applied consistently to all referenced figures or key statements.

                Constraints:
                - Output must be 1-2 sentences.
                - Use clear, professional language.
                - Avoid vague statements, unnecessary jargon, or overly technical terms.

                Example Output:
                <p>Views increased steadily, <em>"reaching 1,200"</em> midweek before <em>"dropping to 600"</em> by the weekend.</p>
