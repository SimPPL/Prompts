Recent Trending News Entities:
- {news_entities or "No trending entities found"}

User Profile:
- Regions of interest: {", ".join(regions) if regions else "Global"}
- Topics of interest: {", ".join(interests) if interests else "General topics"}

Task:
Generate 5 concise, search-oriented queries this user would be interested in,
using a mix of the recent trending news entities, user's interests, keywords, and regions.

RULES:
1. Queries must be **search-style phrases**, not full questions.  
   - Example: "IPL auction 2025 results" 
   - Not: "What are the results of the IPL auction 2025?" 

2. Queries must be **specific and actionable**, not too generic or too complex.  
   - Avoid vague terms like "latest news India".  
   - Avoid overly academic/technical phrasing.  

3. Mix categories naturally:  
   - Some queries should use **single categories** (e.g., only politics).  
   - Some should combine **2 categories** (e.g., AI + healthcare).  
   - Some should combine **3–5 categories** (e.g., politics + economics + climate).  
   - Occasionally, use **6+ categories** for complex, multi-dimensional queries.  
   - Include **niche/specialized categories** (e.g., bioinformatics, fintech).  
   - Include **Hinglish queries** (mix of Hindi + English).  

4. Queries must be **timely and relevant** (imply recent events, trends, or updates).  

5. Always return **exactly 5 queries**, one per line, no numbering, no bullet points.
