SIGNATURE: AnalysisInsights

PROMPT (docstring):
Generate three key insights from social media analysis for user progress tracking.

This signature creates meaningful, LLM-powered insights that replace the previous
template-based progress tracker. The insights are streamed to the frontend
chain-of-thought component and persisted in DynamoDB for later retrieval.

**LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT**: All output MUST be in English regardless of input language.

INPUT FIELDS:
- search_term (str): The user's search query or topic being analyzed
- platform (str): Platform being analyzed (youtube, twitter, reddit, etc.)
- date_range (str): Date range of the analysis (e.g., 'Jan 15-22, 2026')
- total_posts (int): Total number of posts analyzed for this platform
- total_interactions (int): Total interactions (likes, shares, comments) across all posts
- top_entities (List[str]): List of top entities/topics detected with mention counts (e.g., ['Tesla (450 mentions)', 'Elon Musk (320 mentions)'])
- top_actors (List[str]): List of top actors/influencers with engagement metrics (e.g., ['@techreporter (12.5K interactions)', '@newsoutlet (8.2K interactions)'])
- sentiment_overview (str): Brief sentiment breakdown (e.g., '45% positive, 30% neutral, 25% negative')

OUTPUT FIELDS:
- entities_insight (str): Generate a compelling 2-3 sentence insight about the key entities detected.

Focus on:
- Which entities dominated the conversation and why
- Any notable patterns in entity mentions (clustering, co-occurrence)
- What the entity distribution reveals about public attention

Example: "Tesla dominated discussions with 450 mentions, primarily driven by the Cybertruck delivery event. 
The company appeared alongside Elon Musk in 78% of posts, showing tight association between executive and brand. 
Environmental advocacy groups emerged as secondary entities, reflecting polarized reactions to EV claims."

Keep it insightful, specific, and actionable. Avoid generic statements.

- actors_insight (str): Generate a compelling 2-3 sentence insight about the key actors/influencers identified.

Focus on:
- Who drove the most engagement and their influence pattern
- Any notable actor behaviors (coordinated activity, stance patterns)
- What the actor distribution reveals about information flow

Example: "@techreporter generated 3.2x average engagement through exclusive breaking news coverage.
A cluster of 5 automotive journalists collectively drove 40% of total interactions, suggesting industry amplification.
Notably, brand accounts showed muted engagement compared to independent voices."

Keep it insightful, specific, and actionable. Avoid generic statements.

- overall_summary (str): Generate a compelling 2-3 sentence overall summary of the analysis.

Focus on:
- The key narrative or story emerging from the data
- Notable patterns in sentiment, engagement, or timing
- Strategic implications or actionable takeaways

Example: "The Twitter analysis reveals a surge in EV discourse following the Cybertruck launch, with 85% of high-engagement posts 
occurring within 48 hours. Sentiment shifted from 60% positive pre-launch to mixed post-launch as delivery issues emerged.
The conversation is heavily influenced by automotive journalists rather than brand channels, suggesting organic interest over marketing."

Keep it insightful, specific, and actionable. Avoid generic statements.
