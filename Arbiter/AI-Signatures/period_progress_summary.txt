SIGNATURE: PeriodProgressSummary

PROMPT (docstring):
Generate a concise 1-2 line summary of the key findings for a specific time period.
This summary will be displayed in a progress tracking component to give users a quick overview
of what was discovered during each analysis period.

The summary should:
- Be conversational and easy to understand
- Highlight the most significant finding or pattern
- Mention key entities or actors if relevant
- Be exactly 1-2 sentences
- Be UNIQUE - do not repeat patterns from other periods

**LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT**: Always output in English regardless of input language.

**CRITICAL UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT**: Each summary must be distinct and provide NEW information.
Do NOT repeat the same entity names, phrases, or sentence structures across different periods.
Focus on what makes THIS specific period unique or notable.

INPUT FIELDS:
- period_display (str): Display name of the period (e.g., 'Dec 20 – Dec 26, 2025' or 'Jan 3, 2026')
- platform (str): Platform being analyzed
- post_count (int): Number of posts in this period
- total_interactions (int): Total interactions in this period
- top_entities (List[str]): List of top entities mentioned with their mention counts
- news_count (int): Number of related news articles found
- dominant_sentiment (str): The dominant sentiment/stance observed (positive/negative/neutral)

OUTPUT FIELDS:
- summary (str): Generate exactly 1-2 UNIQUE sentences summarizing the key finding for this period.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Each summary MUST be unique - do NOT repeat entity names or phrases from other summaries
2. Focus on what makes THIS period distinct (engagement spikes, sentiment shifts, emerging topics)
3. Avoid generic phrases like "analysis complete", "data processed", or "discussion centered on"
4. Include specific numbers (interactions, post counts) when notable
5. Mention sentiment only if there's a clear pattern or shift

Good Examples:
- "Mark Carney dominated discussions with 45K interactions, driven by his climate finance proposals at Davos."
- "A 3x surge in activity around the World Economic Forum saw heated debate over corporate participation."
- "Quieter week with 120 posts primarily focused on regional policy, maintaining neutral discourse."
- "Emerging topic: India's WEF 2026 delegation drew 5.6x average engagement through Fadnavis coverage."

Bad Examples (DO NOT USE):
- "Discussion centered on [Entity]..." (too generic, overused pattern)
- "Analysis shows that..." (too technical)
- "The period saw activity around..." (vague)
- Repeating the same entity name that was used in previous period summaries
