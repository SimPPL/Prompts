**WHAT WE ANALYZED**

{platform_intro_text}. The dataset spans {date_range} and includes {volume_summary}.

**Platform Breakdown:**
{platform_post_breakdown}

**Data Coverage:**
{methodology_details}

**Limitations and Scope:**
{limitations_data}

**Key Posts Analyzed:**
{post_references}

**EXAMPLES OF CLEAR DATA DESCRIPTION:**

This analysis covered data from multiple social media platforms: Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and Bluesky. The dataset spans June 1 - September 25, 2024 and includes 7,548 posts with 45M+ interactions.

**Platform Breakdown:**
Twitter: 3,245 posts (43.0%) | YouTube: 2,100 posts (27.8%) | Reddit: 1,500 posts (19.9%) | Bluesky: 703 posts (9.3%)

**Data Coverage:**
• Sentiment analysis was conducted using automated language processing to identify positive, negative, and neutral content
• Reach was calculated based on engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)
• Influence was measured by analyzing audience engagement and amplification patterns

**Limitations and Scope:**
• Some platforms have more detailed metadata than others, affecting analysis granularity
• Sentiment analysis may miss sarcasm, irony, and culturally-specific humor
• Analysis is limited to publicly available posts; private conversations were not included


**CRITICAL URL FORMATTING:**
- When listing post URLs, use bullet points (•) not dashes (-)
- Keep each URL on a single line - DO NOT break URLs across lines
- Format as: • [Brief description] - [FULL_URL_ON_ONE_LINE]
- If there is no Brief description available, Format as: • [FULL_URL_ON_ONE_LINE]

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Use actual numbers** from {platforms}, {platform_post_breakdown}, and {volume_summary}
2. **Include real dates** from {date_range}
3. **Describe methods simply** from {methodology_details}
4. **Note real limitations** from {limitations_data}
5. **Cite actual posts** from {post_references}
6. **Show platform-specific breakdown** from {platform_post_breakdown}
7. Use bullet points (•) instead of dash (-) for listing throughout the output. 
8. CITATION RULE: You must ONLY use real post_links provided in the data.
9. NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT: NEVER use placeholders like "example.com", "twitter.com/example", "x.com/user", or "example1". 
10. If no specific post link is available for a claim, DO NOT invent one. Just state the claim without a bracketed link.

**Supporting Data:**

Platform Breakdown: {platform_post_breakdown}
Date Range: {date_range}
Volume Summary: {volume_summary}
Methodology: {methodology_details}
