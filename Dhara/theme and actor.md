Objective: Thematic and Actor Analysis of Content
Perform a comprehensive analysis of user-generated content, focusing on identifying key themes and the types of "actors" or entities that are most prominent within those discussions. This analysis will not identify individual users but rather categorize the roles or nature of the actors (e.g., organizations, support communities, media outlets).
Part 1: Thematic Analysis
Identify Core Themes: Generate a list of the primary themes present in the content.
Detailed Theme Analysis: For each theme, provide a detailed summary of what users are discussing.
Proana & Mental Health Support: For topics like "proana" and "mental health support," explain the distinct nature of the discussions.
For "mental health support groups," what kind of help or advice are users sharing?
For "proana," what is the general content being expressed? (e.g., struggles, shared experiences, a specific point of view). Frame this analysis to describe the type of content, not the specific individuals posting it.
Part 2: Actors and Influence Analysis
Identify Prominent Actor-Types: Instead of individual users, identify the categories of actors that are most active or influential in the dataset. Examples of actor-types could include:
Official organizations or charities.
Support group accounts.
Media outlets.
Individuals who post educational content.
Spam or bot accounts (if applicable).
Accounts dedicated to a specific theme (e.g., a "pro-recovery" account).
Engagement Analysis:
Show the top 3-5 most engaged actor-types based on aggregate metrics like engagement and retweets/shares. Provide insights into why these specific actor-types are receiving high engagement. For example, are official organizations seen as more trustworthy? Does educational content get shared more often?
Cross-Theme Actor Analysis:
For the top 3 most prominent themes, identify the most influential actor-types within each one.
Analyze the relationship between the actor-types and the themes they participate in. For example, "Official organizations" might dominate the "mental health support" theme, while "media outlets" might drive the "public awareness" theme.
Part 3: Sentiment and Content Tone
Sentiment and Emotion per Theme:
Analyze the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each major theme.
Identify the most common emotions expressed within each theme (e.g., sadness, hope, anger, frustration).
Toxic Content Analysis:
Identify if and where toxic or harmful content appears in the dataset, linking it to the relevant themes.
Provide a high-level summary of the nature of this content without quoting specific, sensitive material. For example, "The 'proana' theme contains a high volume of toxic content, including the promotion of harmful behaviors and negative body image."
Analyze the typical sentiment and emotional tone of toxic content.
