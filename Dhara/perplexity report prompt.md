Goal: Generate a comprehensive and visually-driven report on self-harm content and related discussions from a Twitter dataset. The report's purpose is to provide external organizations with key insights into user engagement, content themes, and the sentiment, emotional, and toxic nature of these interactions.
Data Source: I have a CSV file containing Twitter data related to self-harm content. This data includes tweet text, user handles, likes, retweets, dislikes, and links to the original tweets.
Report Structure & Requirements:
1. Executive Summary: Key Insights and General Statistics
Objective: Provide a high-level overview of the report's findings in an easily digestible format.
Key Insights: Summarize the most critical findings in a maximum of four bullet points. Focus on:
Key Events: Highlight specific events or posts that generated a significant amount of engagement and received strong negative or positive sentiment.
Prominent Entities: Identify prominent entities (e.g., individuals, groups, products) discussed and describe the predominant sentiment (agreement or disagreement) toward them.
Subgroup Attitudes: Summarize the attitudes of specific individuals or subgroups. For example, analyze the content from user @snowyfaris to explain what they are expressing frustration about and the level of attention it's receiving.
Audience Interests: Characterize the interests of different audience groups by analyzing which groups show the highest positive and negative attention.


General Statistics: Present the following metrics in a clear, formatted table with exact computed numbers from the dataset:
Total number of posts analyzed.
Total number of unique accounts analyzed.
Total number of interactions (likes, dislikes, retweets).
2. Trend Analysis: Engagement & User Activity Over Time
Objective: Visualize daily trends in user activity and engagement.
Visualizations:
Create a line plot showing the daily number of posts.
Create a line plot showing the daily number of unique users posting.
Create a line plot showing the daily engagement rate (e.g., average likes, retweets, and dislikes per day).
Insights: Provide a detailed analysis for each plot, discussing notable peaks, valleys, or long-term trends and what they might signify.
3. Content & Actor Analysis
Objective: Identify and provide insights into the most influential users and the key topics they are discussing.
Visualizations: Create a pie plot or bar plot showing the top 3 users by engagement and retweets. The plot should display their exact engagement numbers.
Insights:
Identify the top 3 users by their actual handles.
Analyze the kind of content they are posting and the themes they focus on.
Provide insights into why they might be receiving high engagement.
Prominent Entities & Actors: Create a table or summary of the most prominent entities and actors mentioned in the dataset, including actual numbers of mentions or interactions.
4. Sentiment, Emotion, and Toxicity Distribution
Objective: Provide a quantitative breakdown of the emotional, sentimental, and toxic nature of the content.
Visualizations: Create the following pie plots, each showing the exact distribution percentages and raw numbers for their respective categories.
Sentiment Distribution: Plot the distribution of posts into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments.
Emotion Distribution: Plot the distribution of posts into Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Surprise.
Toxicity Distribution: Plot the distribution of posts into Severe Toxicity, Identity Attack, Insult, Profanity, Threat, Sexually Explicit, and Flirtation.
Insights: For each plot, provide insights into the distribution. For the Sentiment Distribution, specifically mention which groups or user handles have a high volume of negative-sentiment posts and include links to specific tweets as examples where feasible.
5. Thematic Analysis
Objective: Identify and summarize the core themes present in the content to understand what users are expressing.
Analysis: Generate a list of key themes and provide a detailed analysis of what users are discussing within each theme. For example, clarify what Proana and mental health support groups represent within the context of the data and what people are expressing in these communities.
Important Constraints & Reminders:
Do not hallucinate numbers. All metrics and percentages must be computed directly from the provided CSV data.
Create the plots, do not just mention them.
Ensure all sections have clear, descriptive titles.
The overall tone and content should be suitable for external organizations, focusing on factual, data-driven insights.
