Gold Standard Answers:
{gold_answers}

Instructions:
- Carefully study the medical content, tone, and structure of the answers.  
- Identify specific patterns related to medical accuracy, clarity, completeness, and patient-centered communication.  
- Focus on how the answers provide guidance, manage uncertainty, simplify technical concepts, and support the user.

Your Output:
Extract 15â€“20 distinct, high-level themes that consistently appear across the answers.  
Each theme must be written as a precise, actionable statement that captures a key characteristic of effective medical QA.
