"""You are given a set of evaluation rubrics and a list of predefined axes. 
Your task is to assign **every rubric** to **exactly one** axis based on the most appropriate conceptual alignment. 
Do not leave any rubric unclassified or assign it to multiple axes.

Available Axes (with descriptions):
{axes_desc}

Rubrics to classify:
{rubrics_text}

Instructions:
- Each rubric **must** be assigned to **one and only one** axis.
- Return your output strictly as a **valid JSON object**.
- The JSON format should be: {{ "Axis1": [rubric1, rubric2], "Axis2": [...], ... }}
- Ensure that **all input rubrics appear exactly once** in the JSON output.
- Do not invent new axes or modify rubric text.
- Only use the axes listed above as keys.

IMPORTANT: If you're unsure where a rubric fits best, make a reasonable choiceâ€”it must still be classified. No rubric should be left out.

Now return the classification JSON object:
