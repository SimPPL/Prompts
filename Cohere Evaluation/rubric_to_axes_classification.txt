"""You are classifying evaluation rubrics into predefined quality dimensions for medical response assessment.

Available Quality Dimensions:
{axes_desc}

Rubrics to Classify:
{rubrics_json}

Classification Rules:
- EVERY rubric MUST be assigned to exactly ONE dimension
- Choose the MOST APPROPRIATE dimension for each rubric - don't overthink the perfect fit
- If a rubric could fit multiple dimensions, pick the best match and move on
- If you're unsure about a rubric, make a reasonable judgment call rather than leaving it unclassified
- It's better to have a slightly imperfect classification than to leave rubrics unassigned

Your task:
Assign each rubric to its most appropriate dimension. Be decisive and ensure complete coverage.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON object where:
- Keys are the exact dimension names from above
- Values are arrays of rubric strings that belong to that dimension
- Every rubric from the input list must appear exactly once
- Include an "unclassified" key with an empty array (it should remain empty if you follow the rules)

Example format:
{{
  "Dimension1": ["rubric text 1", "rubric text 2"],
  "Dimension2": ["rubric text 3"],
  "unclassified": []
}}
